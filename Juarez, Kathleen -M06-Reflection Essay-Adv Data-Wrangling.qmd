## In Step 1, you learned how to design stunning presentation slides with Quarto. What's your impression of the Revealjs presentation? Describe its capabilities as you learned from the presentations. What are its strengths and weaknesses compared with PPT

My impression of RevealJS is that it’s powerful but more technical than PowerPoint. I learned that it can do things like incremental lists, slide transitions, speaker notes, columns, and custom themes. It’s especially useful for presentations that include code or data because everything can be built and customized through Quarto and CSS.

One big strength is how much control you have over the design and layout. You can really customize everything, but it also has a learning curve such as small coding mistakes can cause errors, and it takes more time to set up compared to PowerPoint.

PowerPoint is much easier and more straightforward to use. It’s better for quick, simple presentations. Overall, RevealJS is more flexible, but PowerPoint is more user-friendly

## In Step 2, you were asked to create a Revealjs presentation. Provide a link to the presentation you published on the web. Add at least one reproducible chart or table in the presentation. Briefly describe what the presentation is about. What did you learn from the experience of the Revealjs presentation?

#### See the [presentation](#presentation) for more details

## Pick three different functions, each from a different category. Describe when to use them and give one coding example along with an output for each function. To clarify, you are expected to do literate programming to weave your narratives with the code


## between()
Use between(x, left, right) when you want to filter values that fall within a range (inclusive
```{r}
library(dplyr)

# Keep only cars with mpg between 20 and 30 (inclusive)
cars_20_30 <- mtcars %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column("model") %>%
  filter(between(mpg, 20, 30)) %>%
  select(model, mpg, hp) %>%
  head(6)

cars_20_30

```

## case_when()
when you need if/else logic with multiple conditions to create a new variable
```{r}
mpg_groups <- 
  mtcars %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column("model") %>%
  mutate( mpg_group = case_when(
      mpg >= 25 ~ "High MPG",
      mpg >= 18 & mpg < 25 ~ "Medium MPG",
      TRUE ~ "Low MPG")) %>%
  select(model, mpg, mpg_group) %>%
  head(8)

mpg_groups
```

## across()
when you want to apply the same function to multiple columns at once
```{r}
summary_stats <- 
  mtcars %>%
  summarize(
     across( where(is.numeric),
      list(mean = mean, sd = sd),
      .names = "{.col}_{.fn}" ))

summary_stats
```

The resulting figures represent informed analytical estimates rather than audited financial data and should be interpreted as approximate indicators of market structure and relative competitive positioning.

## Competitive Analysis

![](presentation%20thing.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# AO 5:

To assess whether AI-personalized email sequences (follow-ups, triggered recommendations) increase high-value behaviors such as booking appointments, uploading photos, or repeat purchases

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# AO 5 Methodology

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Approach

-   Implement AI-personalized follow-ups and triggered recommendations
-   Compare outcomes against non-personalized email sequences
-   Use experimentation to evaluate effectiveness

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Analysis

::: nonincremental
-   Logistic Regression: Estimate likelihood of key actions (booking, uploading, repurchasing)
:::

::: incremental
-   ANOVA - comparing treatment vs. control groups
:::
