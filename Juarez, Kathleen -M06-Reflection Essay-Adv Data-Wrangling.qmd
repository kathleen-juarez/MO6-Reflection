# Essay portion of assignment

## In Step 1, you learned how to design stunning presentation slides with Quarto. What's your impression of the Revealjs presentation? Describe its capabilities as you learned from the presentations. What are its strengths and weaknesses compared with PPT

## In Step 2, you were asked to create a Revealjs presentation. Provide a link to the presentation you published on the web. Add at least one reproducible chart or table in the presentation. Briefly describe what the presentation is about. What did you learn from the experience of the Revealjs presentation?

See the [presentation](#presentation) for more details

## Pick three different functions, each from a different category. Describe when to use them and give one coding example along with an output for each function. To clarify, you are expected to do literate programming to weave your narratives with the code

# Revealjs is Cool! A Presentation by Kathleen {#presentation}

## Slide 1

::: {.alert .alert-primary}
This should appear in your custom primary color.

## Slide 2

# Slide 3

# Section: Lists & Fragments

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Incremental lists (automatic)

-   First point appears
-   Then this one
-   Then this one

> Because `incremental: true` is set in YAML, lists reveal item-by-item.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Manual incremental list (only some items)

::: nonincremental
-   This appears immediately (NOT incremental)
-   This also appears immediately
:::

::: incremental
-   This starts incremental (manual)
-   Then this
-   Then this
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Fragments (fine-grained control)

Use fragments when you want *non-list* elements to appear stepwise:

[This appears first.]{.fragment}

<p class="fragment">

This appears second (a paragraph).

</p>

::: fragment
A whole block can be a fragment too.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Content overflow (scroll inside slide)

Sometimes text is too long. You can make a scrollable region:

::: scroll-box
**Scrollable content area** - Line 1 - Line 2 - Line 3 - Line 4 - Line 5 - Line 6 - Line 7 - Line 8 - Line 9 - Line 10 - Line 11 - Line 12 - Line 13 - Line 14 - Line 15
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Columns

::: columns
::: column width="55%" \### Left column - Bullet A - Bullet B - Bullet C
:::

::: column width="45%" \### Right column A figure, callout, or small table fits well here.

> Tip: Use columns for “copy + visual” layouts. ::::::::

::::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Speaker notes

Visible to you (Presenter View), hidden from audience.

::: notes
Talk track: - Define the KPI - Explain what “incremental lists” means - Call out how overflow is handled with `.scroll-box`
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Asides & Footnotes

### Aside (small side note)

::: aside
This is an **aside**. It’s useful for secondary info that shouldn’t compete with the main message.
:::

### Footnote example

This statement has a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: Footnotes work in revealjs and are great for small citations or clarifications.

# Section: Theme & Styling

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
cool cool McGruel
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
That's what she said
